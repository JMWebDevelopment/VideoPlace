Development Roadmap

Resources
-- I like this organization structure and want to move to it: http://code.tutsplus.com/series/writing-maintainable-wordpress-themes--cms-659
-- Here is a Genesis Starter theme we can learn from for organization they use bootstrap and we can use foundation: http://genesissandbox.com/
-- Another to learn from: https://github.com/cdils/in-the-beginning

To Dos:
-- Better Organization to customize Genesis the way we want it
-- Better Organization to customize WordPress the way we want it
---- remove all traces of customizer (we are building custom themes this feature is not needed)
---- remove all widgets we did not style for
-- Folders to customize plugins an how they interact with dashboard
-- Other Foundation elements we want at our finger tips
-- WordPress code standards
-- Well organized and becomes the bases for all our projects

Down the road:
-- Gulp
-- Add starter plugins and dev plugins to git modules from their respective repos
-- explore composer for dependencies
